# TraveloggiaReactNative


// cmd M - on android
// cmd D - on ios
/*

to open the piece of shit react-native-debugger 
( very much to be confused with the react-dev-tools )
in a fresh terminal window type: ( to install download dmg from internet or suffer the consequences )
open "rndebugger://set-debugger-loc?host=localhost&port=8081"
BUT it doesnt work

for good old fashioned chrome dev tools type
cmd alt I ( the letter i ) :)
